# Global COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker 


Data Visualization, Tableau



### **Situation**

The COIVD-19 pandemic has been a global crisis, that has affected millions worldwide and included an arguably uneven rollout of vaccinces. I thought that it would be interesting, to use Tableau to take a closer look at the the development of the vaccine rollout worldwide and determine if this was the case.


### **Task**

I tasked myself with designing and creating an interactive COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker in Tableau,key metrics related to the global vaccination program. 

- Creating calculated fields to get the "share of people fully vaccinated" and "share of people partilly vaccinated"
- Created a scatterplot with a trendline to showcase the correlation between a country's vaccination rate and GDP
- Created filters to make the dashboard interactive
- Created date parameter
- Formattet the dashoboard with icons and colours 


### **Action**

As always, I begun with identifying the challengse the dashboard is meant to solve, then I outline the needs/requirements of the dasbhoard based on it for the various stakeholders, then I plan the dashboard and finally I began the creation of the dashboard.

To create the dashboard, I utilized the Our World in Data COVID vaccination dataset which had data from the first 1.5 years. I designed the dashboard to include key metrics such as the share of the population that has been partially or fully vaccinated, vaccine doses administered daily, boosters administered daily, and GDP correlation with vaccination program performance. The dashboard also includes cool map charts and allows filtering by date, country, and continent. The preview of the dashboard is available below.


### **Result**

Some of the conclusions that can be drawn from the final dashboard are the following:

- Strong correlation beteween a country's GDP and vaccination rate
- Quarter is an outlier on the scatterplot of a country's GDP and vaccination 
- Gibraltar have the higest share of people fully vaccinated over population


Please feel free to interact with the dashboard, to make your own conclusions


**Recommendationns** 

1. Due to the high correlation between a country's GDP and vaccination rate, the World Health Organisation (WHO) could look into how further distribute vaccines to the most poor nations
2. Based on the the relatively high rate of of people not being vaccinated, I would recommend to the WHO to identify main reasons why people are not being vaccinated
3. Use the filter to understand which nations have a high gap between fully and partilly vaccinated people, to combat any barriers for those nations to get fully vaccinated
